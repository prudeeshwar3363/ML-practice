# 📊 ML Day 1 – Vector Basics & Dot Product (From Scratch)

## 🚀 Objective

This project focuses on understanding the mathematical foundation of Machine Learning by implementing vector operations and dot product both using NumPy and from scratch.

Machine Learning models internally rely heavily on vector mathematics. Understanding vectors and dot products is the first step toward building ML algorithms from scratch.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Scalars, Vectors, Matrices
- NumPy arrays
- Vector addition
- Element-wise multiplication
- Dot product
- Manual dot product implementation
- Why dot product is important in ML

## 📌 Why This Is Important

In Machine Learning, prediction is calculated using:

y = W · X + b

Where:
- W = weights
- X = feature vector
- · = dot product
- b = bias

Understanding dot product helps in understanding:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Networks
- Gradient Descent
