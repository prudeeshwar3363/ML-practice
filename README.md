# 📝 Daily Reflection Log

### Day 01
- Learned how vectors represent feature space in ML models. 
- Implemented dot product manually and compared with NumPy.
- Gained clarity on how linear models compute predictions internally.

### Day 02
- Understood how datasets are represented as matrices in ML.
- Implemented matrix multiplication manually.
- Simulated ML prediction using matrix-vector multiplication.
- Gained clarity on how linear models compute outputs efficiently.

### Day 03
- Implemented mean, variance, and standard deviation from scratch.
- Understood how standardization transforms data distribution.
- Verified mathematically that scaled data has mean ≈ 0 and std ≈ 1.
- Gained clarity on why feature scaling is essential before training models.

### Day 04
- Learned probability fundamentals and conditional probability.
- Implemented Bayes theorem and understood how rare events affect predictions.
- Connected probability concepts to Naive Bayes classifier in ML.

### Day 05 – Cost Function & Gradient Descent
- Today was a major breakthrough in my ML journey.  
- I implemented Mean Squared Error and Gradient Descent manually, which helped me understand how machine learning models actually learn from data.  
- Observing the cost decrease over iterations gave me clear intuition about optimization and parameter updates.  
- I now understand how weights move toward optimal values and why learning rate plays a critical role in convergence.  
- This removed the “black box” feeling around model training and strengthened my mathematical foundation.

### Day 06 – Linear Regression From Scratch
- Today I built a complete Linear Regression model from scratch using Gradient Descent.
- I implemented the full training loop, observed parameter convergence, and validated results against sklearn.
- This strengthened my understanding of optimization and how supervised learning models are structured internally.
- Machine learning now feels less like a black box and more like engineered mathematics.

### Day 07 – Model Validation & Experiments

- Today I tested my linear regression model under different conditions including noisy data, reduced iterations, and extreme learning rates.
- I observed how noise slightly alters the slope, how insufficient iterations cause underfitting, and how large learning rates lead to divergence.
- This strengthened my understanding of optimization behavior and model stability.
- I now understand how hyperparameters affect convergence and why residual analysis is important in regression.
